         Our textbook:
         "The main advantage of using streams over the operations we have introduced earlier (such as for-each loop)
         It comes down to readability."

         It may be a bit controversial, especially when we introduce a new syntax, but with more practice,
         you'll love stream API and how it makes your life easier! :)

         Remember: Rome wasn't built in a day!
